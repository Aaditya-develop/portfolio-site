          Hi, I'm <strong>Aaditya Chandola</strong> — an aspiring software engineer with a strong interest in <u>machine learning</u> and <em>artificial intelligence</em>. I’m passionate about exploring how technology can be used to solve everyday problems and make a meaningful impact. Born in <b>New Brunswick, New Jersey</b> in 2005, I’ve always had a curious mindset and a love for building and learning new things.<br><br>
          Beyond tech, I enjoy <strong>playing soccer</strong>, <u>running in the mornings</u>, <i>cooking nutritious meals</i>, and spending quality time with my girlfriend and family. I’m always looking for opportunities to grow, improve my skills, and contribute to innovative, real-world projects.
